    "Grid Search CV (Cross-Validation) is a technique used in machine learning to systematically search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given model. Hyperparameters are values that are set before the learning process begins and affect the performance of a machine learning algorithm but are not learned from the data itself. Grid Search CV helps find the hyperparameters that yield the best performance on a validation set while guarding against overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Grid Search CV works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter Grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "You define a grid of hyperparameter values that you want to search through. For each hyperparameter, you specify a set of possible values to test.\n",
    "Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is divided into k subsets (folds), and the learning algorithm is trained on k-1 folds while using the remaining fold for validation. This process is repeated k times so that each fold serves as the validation set once.\n",
    "For each combination of hyperparameters in the grid, a model is trained and evaluated using cross-validation.\n",
    "Model Training and Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each combination of hyperparameters, a model is trained on the training portion of each fold and evaluated on the validation portion.\n",
    "The evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC) is calculated for each fold, and the average metric across all folds is used as the performance measure for that combination of hyperparameters.\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of hyperparameters that results in the best performance (highest or lowest, depending on the evaluation metric) is selected as the optimal choice.\n",
    "Model Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "After Grid Search CV is complete, you choose the best-performing model based on the optimal hyperparameters. This model is then tested on an independent test set to assess its generalization performance.\n",

    "Choosing Between Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV:\n",
    "The choice between Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV depends on the specific characteristics of your problem and the computational resources available:\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search CV: Choose Grid Search when you have a small set of hyperparameters with discrete and limited value ranges. If your search space is not too large and you have sufficient computational resources, Grid Search can help you find the optimal solution through an exhaustive search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized Search CV: Choose Randomized Search when your hyperparameter space is large and continuous, or when you have limited computational resources. Randomized Search can quickly explore a diverse set of hyperparameters without the need to evaluate every possible combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining Both: In some cases, using both techniques can be beneficial. You can start with Randomized Search to quickly narrow down promising regions of the hyperparameter space and then use Grid Search to perform a finer-grained search within those regions.\n"

    "Data leakage, also known as information leakage or data snooping, refers to the situation in which information from the test set or future data unintentionally influences the model during training. Data leakage can lead to overly optimistic model performance estimates and can result in a model that does not generalize well to new, unseen data. It is a significant problem in machine learning because it can lead to misleading results and undermine the reliability of the model.\n",

You have a historical dataset that includes features like transaction amount, merchant ID, and transaction time.
